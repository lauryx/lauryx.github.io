One of the worst things that we could do right now is freeze and be paralysed. Maybe the economy in a sense is freezing, and things are dropping, and there's an incredible amount of unknowns and uncertainty, but there's also some people who know what to do and have been seeing the opportunity in this.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I want to be very clear: it's not being opportunistic, it's a matter of seeing how they have to recast their thinking, their strategies, their investments to see this through and get to positive ground.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; On the other side, basically what they've said to me is that crisis investing has an entirely different set of rules than "normal investing" or investing during normal times. When all this started unfolding, I was seeing people saying:</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; * what should I do?</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; * the markets way down, do I sell?</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; do I get out try buying cash?</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; do I buy gold?</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; should&nbsp; I hold real estate?</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; To be honest I don't know the answers to these questions but I have access to people who do know what to do.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; There are very very smart people who are world-class in things like the economy investing.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dr. Patrick Gentempo is&nbsp; a well-known and respected star in the world of health, wellness and business.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If you watched his docu-series, he made dozens of interviews with financial experts that had incredible advice for us so what could.&nbsp; Now the game has changed, the playing field is completely destabilized, the rules are all out the window.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dr. Gentempo went to these experts and asked</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What do we do now?"</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The answers that he got have been mind-blowing,&nbsp; so I am excited to be able to offer you in this time of crisis a project that Dr Gentempo and his company Revealed Films called</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Crisis Investing 2020</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It's a series of interviews that they did online, they contacted these people, interviewed them, recorded, put this information together and now they offer it to you at no charge.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; There is a free series right now that addresses the absolute current topics and must-know information in this circumstance.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I can't over stress the importance of seeing this information, it's incumbent upon you to look at this information, digest this information. The people depend upon you, your loved ones, everybody is literally invested in this information whether they know it or not.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I want to urge you to sign up for this, watch this documentary,&nbsp; this information is real time, it's as current as it gets.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I'm asking you to share this with the key people in your life that you think will benefit from this free series.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; This&nbsp; is going to change a lot of lives it's going to get people out of paralysis and have them move forward with some confidence, with some understanding, with some knowledge.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Your&nbsp; mission here is to get as many people as possible to look at this information, understand it, and take the action that they definitely and desperately need to be taking right now.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Knowing what to do and moving forward with confidence is the most important thing all of us can do right now.</p>
