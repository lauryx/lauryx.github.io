After a period of recklessness or unconsciousness to the effects of the outbreak of coronavirus in China, the financial markets have finally realized that the shares could not remain unscathed. For two weeks in particular, but in fact since the beginning of the year, almost all assets were put in recession mode, except share. Oil prices fell by more than $ 10 a barrel before declining this week, the French interest rates had plunged into negative territory, the prices of industrial raw materials had declined significantly.

Today, the clocks are returned on time. In five trading days, the stock price fell more than 10% and crossed his "comfort zone", we situions for the CAC 40 between 5.600 and 6.100 percentage points. This situation is exceptional, as there just a week we attain the point beyond which we offered to sell the shares; Today, we propose to start buying ... In the current hyper volatility, which is the counterpart of hyper liquidity, of course we must mention the old saying: "do not catch a falling knife" . Experience tells us that buying too early can lead to record massive losses. In this difficult time for all investment professionals, we offer our analysis of the situation.

Two possible scenarios

We consider two possible scenarios for the coronavirus, although obviously this exercise is particularly sensitive to lead. Recall that we are not facing a risk but a reality, a major health crisis, and thus a total uncertainty.

The first scenario is more favorable, is to apply to rich countries, the Chinese pattern. For one to two months, the global pandemic led to significant containment operations, which results in disruption of economic activities that can easily imagine. The relay through social networks of fear of the disease is, however, a formidable aggravation factor. Just like the 2008 financial crisis, we are not facing a recession but a judgment of economic activity.

In the favorable scenario, the stop is relatively short, because after a two-month period, the number of new cases decreases and the outbreak ends. The virus is less virulent and dies a natural death ... This is for a term economic "soft patch" of one to two quarters. The second scenario is more pessimistic since the cessation of activity induced by confinement operations and the stress of economic actors, lasts at least one year, the time to find a medication ad hoc. Damage is naturally much greater. The activity arrest induced sustained decline in GDP of around 2% globally, over a year or more. In all cases the recession is inevitable, especially in Asia and Europe.

Avoid soaring corporate claims

What can central banks to counter the effects of the epidemic? What must be avoided is a surge in business losses, delinquencies, capable of generating a chain reaction in the financial markets via the collapse in corporate bonds. It is stopping companies collections that leads them to die because they must also honor their commitments in particular vis-à-vis their employees. Western central banks must again be creative, as in 2008, facing the absolute urgency and an exceptional regime. They could and should usher in a new form of quantitative easing (monetary policy accommodative, Ed), which directly benefit businesses, and (why not?) To individuals. Commercial banks could then, on first request of their client, providing operating funding envelope credit an amount to be refinanced immediately to the central bank, according to a specific device.

The announcement of a device of this nature is able to create an impressive rebound in stock prices. We recommend investors to start buying stocks, in a progressive manner, focusing initially high quality companies at good visibility. It is still early to massively buy the most undervalued stocks, those most exposed to economic conditions, and whose assessment is still very attractive.
