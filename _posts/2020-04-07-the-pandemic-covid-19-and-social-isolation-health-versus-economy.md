Andrés Ferrari and André Moreira Cunha, professors of the Department of Economics and International Relations of the UFRGS
gained prominence in the current debate on the pandemic COVID-19 criticism of social isolation strategy. This is based essentially on the idea that the economic impacts of isolation are greater than their benefits in terms of public health. It is argued that any social contact restriction should be targeted at risk groups of this pandemic, that is, people over 60 years of age or who are suffering from chronic diseases. As a consequence, the rest of society should return to normal as soon as possible in order to reduce the economic impact of this new form of "sudden stop" [1].

Proponents of the "return to normality" argue that deaths caused by COVID-19 as a proportion of the total population are lower than those deaths from other illnesses or social processes, such as murder and traffic accidents. And, by logical imposition, if the economy does not usually stop due to such problems, there would be prevented by the effect of an even less lethal virus.

To date (March 25), official sources [2] reported that, overall, there are 459,000 people who have been demonstrably infected COVID-19. The number of deaths associated with pandemic is 21 thousand people (5% of total), while the patients have recovered are 114 thousand (25%) and those who are already infected are 324,000 (70%). The latter universe, 310 000 people (96% of 324,000) have mild symptoms, while 14 000 (4%) require intensive care. Another way to look at the numbers is from the 135 thousand cases already closed universe considered as patients or recovered (85%) or died (15%).

It is reasonable to assume that compared with the global population of 7.7 billion people, the number of infected or dead is negligible so far. More precisely, 0.006% and 0.0003%, respectively. These figures may vary depending on the number of infected people is a multiple of those that are proven to COVID-19. In any case, this does not alter the fact that, so far, there is, in effect, a statistical argument that the current pandemic has a low incidence and, therefore, should not be an excuse to paralyze economies.

Despite the apparent logic of numbers, the rationale underlying the proposed "normal life" is wrong for several reasons.

First, the current indicators of contamination and death are holding at relatively low levels before the total population groups precisely because they have applied as universal as social isolation. If there were social isolation, the infected population could reach somewhere between 60% and 80% of the world total, according to estimates by Dr. Gabriel Leung, an expert who has been with the World Health Organization and dealing with the pandemic CODIV -19.

With an increasing rate of infected, the total number of deaths would of course be much higher, with estimates that can vary from 1% of the population (77 million people), according to the calculations of Gourinchas [3] to the case that only half of the global population becomes infected and there is some flattening of the epidemiological curve; or 5% of the total population of the planet, considering 100% of infection and no flattening, ie a simple linear extrapolation of mortality rates observed in the present.

Second, the return to normality should consider that contaminated possible to have mild symptoms or even those without symptoms may not have objective conditions - given the disorganization of the various economic systems (transportation, communications, supply etc.) and toilets - and subjective (psychological impacts) to return to work.

How to assume that the social and economic life will follow its natural course with the increasing contamination is, maintaining the current proportions, 4% of those infected experience severe symptoms and, therefore, require intensive care physicians and hospital resources, including ICU beds, equipment to support breathing etc.? To illustrate the problem, just a simple reasoning: if 50% of the population is infected, we have about five million people will require special attention, a number that far exceeds the human capacity, material and existing hospital resources in the country. The same goes for the other countries.

Thus, for more than the current pandemic the mortality rate is relatively low, even when compared with other humanitarian tragedies - think in the 70 to 80 million killed in World War II (or 12% of the population at the time) - the impacts on the health system and society as a whole these figures are really worrying to consider the case of immediate normality.

Also by virtue of logic, we come to a third point: the potential number of deaths and infected people who would demand special attention is so great that possibly produce even greater disruption than that produced by the current isolation. This is at least the result of epidemiological flatten the curve and greatly reduce the number of infected patients and serious, mainly dead. Thus, from the same coldness of the numbers that the proponents of "normalization has been" in impose, it is fair to estimate that the business world to the return costs may be greater than its benefits. Or even greater than the costs of the current isolation.

The normal argument does not deal with due attention to the problem of speed of transmission and health care costs. Proponents are fixed in mortality, which is focused on specific risk groups. Ignore or omit the fact that, as soon as possible to return to "normal", the greater the spread and the pressure on health systems. The saturation of these also affect patients with other diseases unrelated to COVID-19. These could become casual victims of a crisis that can not be avoided, at least can be mitigated.

Proponents of normality simplify an issue that is complex and serious. The COVID-19 does not offer the simple-minded and easy exits societies. The economic and social life will be deeply affected. Instead of denying reality, advocates of "normality", particularly those located in positions of power in society, whether in the public sector, whether in the private, should be working to minimize the direct effects - humanitarian and health public - and indirect of the ongoing crisis.

As we have shown in the studies available on this blog FCE [4], this is what governments are making major advanced and emerging countries. Resources are being mobilized between 10% and 20% of those products, only in the early rounds of the crisis facing. Quite possibly these figures will grow to the extent that materializes the reality that the crisis is serious and that its effects will be long and deep. Before them, the 2% of GDP already announced by the federal government reveal the shyness of State action in the country in a context of such gravity [5].

Apart from the normal argument, there is the path of rationality and state action guided by the pursuit of the common good. In these frameworks, and considering the economic perspective, the management of this crisis demands focus, serenity and responsibility. It is a priority to maintain the production and supply of those goods and services considered essential for the preservation of human life and social structure. One should not lose time with secondary discussions, ideological or political, about how society should be organized on the role of the State and markets and so on.

As important as these issues are, the moment demand action. Governments marked by pro-market ideology and anti-state, such as Germany, United States and United Kingdom, to name a few, are working with large financial margin. Focus on maintaining the reproduction of social life and thus the preservation of jobs, businesses and income, realizing that the central problem is not fiscal restraint in advance of the state, which does not exist when you have the possibility of issuing currency and debt . But rather of maintaining social order.

Yet from the point of view of rational management of the crisis, it is important to remember that public health experts indicate that there is a certain time frame for the maintenance of social isolation, something between three and four months. This may be higher than what we want, but allows at least in theory, the competent authorities organize the parameters for the functioning of society in a minimum standard. Thus, for example, you can consider: the creation of comprehensive programs and massive non-conditional cash transfer that preserves the purchasing power of households, at least at levels to meet basic needs; the creation of credit lines to be passed by public banks in interest rate conditions and deadlines which will allow companies to meet their essential commitments (salary payments, taxes and suppliers) and the self-employed entrepreneurs survive this time; the suspension of payment of state debts and dilation of time limits for payment of debts and bank current tax, and so on.

There is time to act in a context of exceptionality but in order to maintain order and social peace. The preservation of income, particularly people who need it most, will be vital to avoid a contamination process in the economic sphere. This is expressed in the fact that, no income, household consumption tends to fall, pushing even more cash businesses, which are forced to resign, which reduces the mass of labor income, generates new pressure on businesses and so on. As economists have learned - at least since the Great Depression of the 1930s - and are adopting the practice now, in times of depression the state spent to keep the economy is a matter of life and death (and not an ideological option).

Social isolation can help reduce contamination and thereby give priority to the care of those who need to work with a view to preserving this minimum basis of social activities. It is necessary precisely to that normality can be re-establish as soon as possible. Experts already demonstrated two realities: mortality rates are really low, but the risk of contamination is very high. It is also shown that the vast majority of those infected will experience very mild symptoms similar to the common flu. This argument, which is current by advocates of "normal already," can not obscure the fact that, if rates are low, the absolute numbers tend to be very high, with dramatic effects on the health system. Thus, "normalistas" speak for resumption of order, but sow a deep disorganization potential of society.

In short, not practice temporary social isolation can produce a social catastrophe which, in consequence, will also be economical. And do not preserve the incomes of workers and entrepreneurs in an isolation environment further aggravate a picture that is already sufficiently dramatic. There will be three or four months in which we will only have one certainty: there is no room to imagine merely individual outputs. The COVID-19 is leaving us a hard message, but clear: either we build better alternatives together, or perish collectively.
