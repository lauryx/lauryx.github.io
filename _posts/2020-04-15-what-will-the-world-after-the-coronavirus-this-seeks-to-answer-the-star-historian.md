The coronavirus has probably never seen a set of challenges to communities, and most people are forced to give up the usual way of life. But how to continue life when the danger is past? What Lessons will be back on this period?

Yuval Noah Harari, Israeli historian, author raises questions about his article published in the Financial Times that what life will be like after the coronavirus. As he writes, the decisions that are now being of individuals and countries, not only in the health system but also the economy, politics and culture can transform. We must therefore reflect on the fact that the kind of world we want to live after the storm passed.

One of the initial idea to the emergency measures, short-term rules become everyday life in the long run. The emergency decisions are made in a few hours, that can be taken normally take years. Still immature, and even veszéléyes technologies are used, this phenomenon is comparing large-scale social experiment.

As he writes, in the current crisis, we face two particularly important election, the first and the other decisions of national isolation and global solidarity between totalitarian surveillance and civil empowerment.

In order to stop the epidemic, the entire population must comply with certain requirements. To achieve this, two main modes to offer: one in which governments monitor the people and punish those who break the rules. The other is when people did not adhere to the standards, they are forced to, but because it is dictated by their knowledge. To do so, however, the need to, inter alia, to obtain a sufficient amount of reliable information.


Today, for the first time in the history of humanity it allows the technology to listen to everyone at once, and several countries have introduced new tools in connection with the outbreak. The best-known case of China, which is held in a cell under close observation, used hundreds of millions of facial recognition camera, and require people to measure their body temperature, and to report back to him with the general state of health.

The Chinese authorities are not only able to quickly identify infected, but are also able to track their movements and determine that came in contact with. There are a number of mobilapplikáció that warns people when infected are in their vicinity.

Similar measures have been made in Israel: the Israeli Security Service was authorized to use the technology to observe the corona patients that is otherwise used in  the fight with the terrorists.

The outbreak normalize the use of mass surveillance equipment in countries which have rejected them, as well as a shift can be made between internal and external monitoring tools: They do not just want to keep track of what they clicked on, but also what was the finger joint temperature and our blood pressure at the moment.

The use of emergency pudding and feelings

One problem is that we do not know how to listen to us and what can even the next few years - the historian says. If body temperature and the heart rate are monitored in each subject, company or public authority can easily cross the blood pressure of feelings: the same technology that detects coughs, recognizes that we laugh at us or what we are angry. Our feelings are not only predictable, but also be manipulated and can easily sell us anything.

One could say that this is only temporary, but the transitional arrangements often survive into the emergency, especially when new emergencies are in the pipeline. As an example, puts that Israel has never announced the end of emergency proclaimed in the first Arab-Israeli war in 1948, officially, which confirmed the legitimacy of various temporary measures to censorship through land confiscation in pudingkészítés rules, which have been canceled latter only in 2011.

Instead of soap police civic responsibility

If people have to choose between the right to privacy and health, understandably usually choose the latter, any person to produce such a choice yet significant problem. Suddenly ought to enjoy both. As he writes, they are not required to stop the epidemic totalitarian surveillance devices, but rather is a civil strict liability is the key: the punishment is not the only one that causes people to comply with regulations. The scientific facts and well-informed to take effect, as for example, the majority of people did not wash their hands, because this force, but because he is aware of the importance of this.

This in turn requires that the people have confidence in science, the media and the authorities have, however, thoroughly shaken confidence in recent times in many places, and it can take political power. However, not too late to restore confidence and achieve the technology of household responsibilities, rather than stand at the service of authoritarian rule. The same tools that allow governments to monitor individuals, individuals also can monitor the country's leadership.

National or global plan of separation?

The other choice that puts in the isolation-national and global solidarity. The outbreak and the ensuing economic crisis is a global problem and, as he says, only managed global cooperation. Primarily need to ensure the flow of information between countries, while also sharing of medical instruments and expertise are needed, so as soon as possible a global plan needs to be established.

Stresses that a comprehensive agreement is also required in connection with the trip: causes huge difficulties when hung all international trip for months, it should at least in some cases ensure, for example movement of scientists, physicians, journalists, politicians and businessmen, of course, the appropriate precautions.

As he writes's conclusions, the crisis is possible that mankind recognize the dangers of disunity and decide if he continues on this path, or moving towards global solidarity.
