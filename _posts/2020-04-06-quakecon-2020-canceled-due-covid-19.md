In the long series of events related to the world of gaming canceled due to coronavirus (COVID-19), here unfortunately it also adds QuakeCon 2020 Annual Event Lan Party run by ZeniMax Media, the owner of the house development of DOOM Eternal, now its XXV edition, for the first time since 1996 is canceled.

A few hours ago with a statement of the QuakeCon organizers announced the cancellation of the event. They also know that depending on how the pandemic will evolve, with its collaborators will evaluate alternative event. Here for you the official press release.

To all our friends about QuakeCon community.

QuakeCon has always been a special event for us and for you, a time when we gather to play and build ties that, for some, have lasted for a quarter century.

In recent weeks we have spent much time discussing how we could continue with the QuakeCon this year, especially in view of the 25th year of the event. However, with all the logistical difficulties and uncertainties that we currently face due to the pandemic COVID-19, we have made the difficult decision to cancel this year's QuakeCon. The health and safety of our employees, volunteers, suppliers, sponsors and players will always be our top priority, and in these times it seemed to us not correct to speak of a rally when rally is the last thing we should do right now.

Although we do not know how the pandemic will have evolved this August, but we know that you can not complete the work and planning with partners, suppliers, volunteers and other measures for the success of QuakeCon.

We thank all of you, especially the volunteers, for all your support and work in the construction of this event year after year. We hope to work with you to find alternatives to celebrate the spirit of QuakeCon this August, and we look forward to returning to this incredible event next year.

Until then, be careful, take care of each other and play.
