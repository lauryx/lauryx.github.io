Sooner or later this pandemic will go. Will the world just then? I do not believe! After these unimaginable social experiments conducted on a global scale, the findings (and consequences) of these days will be more extensive as this crisis will last longer. See:

Inflation. What we see now in all sections is flooding the economy with money. Money without coverage services or products. Give money to those who stay at home, those who have seen their business to zero, the stop may occur. No government can now say to someone who receives the blow after blow that can not give any help. Some money in empty wallet. Where from? From the printing press. Which only means that at the end we will all pay the bill. Budgetary or workers at multinational companies large and small. Money does not come from Mars.

Rethinking the role of automation and machine enhancement. A man's exclusion from the process. Certainly nobody wants to stand in front of progress. But no you can not look the other way when restructuring and layoffs are on the ground to increase profitability through automation and robotics. We find it extremely risky and utopian to believe that all those placed on the loose after machine enhancement will come to have a happy career in the service industry. Or hospitality. We see now fallen to the ground. We should act more clearly which is the company's duty to companies that give people out in the name of technological advancement. It seems that three redundancy payments and a collective bargaining agreement signed in knee does not help. Nor mockery of EU funds chopped irresponsible restructuring projects in false labor. A national fund (or European) social support for those expelled on grounds of robotics?

Rethinking strategic economic independen≈£elor. On behalf of increased profitability and reduced costs we have accepted that we can trust ease in the Chinese plagued by blindness on the production line so as to send us materials and parts in Europe at the price of two peanuts. We disposed of unprofitable industries in Europe without realizing that the valve can close and cheap abundance differently from political movements or various commercial maneuvers. We can decide if we remain dependent Indian low payout (a company owned by celebrities often monstrously rich in Europe or US) or bring back jobs and reduce the profits of those characters. And will have to decide.

Access to health services and their type will be changed. We continue to accept the impoverished strata of society, the non-taxable health insurance, to be left to chance? Or is everyone's concern to ensure vaccination, access to treatment and health check-ups basal, so as to protect the entire population? We have to understand that part of your protection comes from protecting the other that, here, has to bear. On the other hand, medical administrative decisions are taken these days in category "I have five patients who require respiratory support and only two devices - who put them? Of 7 children, former fighter in Afghanistan, Mr. President, pregnant young scientist 77 years with chances for the Nobel Prize? "These decisions will mark the decisions to be taken after. Volunteers for Afghanistan? - why? Scientist with a life dedicated to science for a miserable salary, but a beautiful posthumous fame? - for whom? My baby born here? ... Our decisions, and the system will take into account what is happening now.

Work from home. In this category we have something else outside the IT industry or telemarketing. We have, for example, telemedicine and e-learning. Until recently considered the whims of some greedy for cost savings management. Or some who want progress for the sake of progress. Suddenly now all looking for solutions here. And some of the solutions implemented by force now will prove the skeptics that are functional and even beneficial. Telemedicine to reduce unnecessary movements of the sick from one region to another? E-learning to reduce the shortage of educational facilities or demand for places in homes? Or to increase salaries in education through more efficient distribution of educational services? Why not?!

We could continue to scrutinize the future trying to understand how we think after. Perhaps I do now each of us. The world in all its areas will certainly try to draw the appropriate conclusions. But we? We'll isolate? We will be unhappy? We live with a wound not closed? We look with hatred or fear about? Well ... probably not. As a physician (which means that the proponent of scientific evidence) have an argument. Some scientists serious, not like those cited in pink or fake news sites, watched how people who had lost a leg in a car accident managed to overcome this trauma. They measured quality of life and depression occurred well after the sun came up on a hospital bed with his foot amputated. As expected all, the quality of life of these people was initially led down badly. But unexpectedly, after about a year, people with amputated leg proved that managed to get through it and see the world as white, pink or blue like everyone else.

Now it's a war. If history, then here, the science shows that no fear or depression in this war will not last forever! To prepare and begin to take care of that, too. Observing what happens, trying to understand rationally reflecting on what we have to do the day after coronavirus. Leading world went on as it always has!
