German researcher: "So far, there was no transmission of the virus found in the supermarket, restaurant or hairdresser"

Professor Hendrik Streeck, director of the Institute of Virology at the University Hospital of Bonn, says that the new coronavirus is transmitted not as easy as people think.

In a press conference, the teacher explained the methodology of its new study in Heinsberg, "epicenter" outbreak COVID-19 in Germany and spoke of possible plans that Germany could apply them gradually to return to life " normal ", according to RTL.

In recent weeks, the team has completed substantial research carried out by sampling and investigation of the region Heinsberg houses, where they were reported over 1,400 cases of infection with the novel coronavirus. Heinsberg has a population of about 250,000 people and recorded 46 deaths.

Streeck says that the virus could not be found on doorknobs or pet fur.

"There is no significant risk to contract the disease when they go shopping. Serious outbreaks have occurred after people have lived together for a longer period of time, for example, apr√®s ski parties in Ischgl, Austria, "said Hendrik Streeck.

Professor says no virus found "living" surface "When I took samples from door handles, telephones or toilets, it was not possible to cultivate the virus in the laboratory."

"To get HIV would need someone coughing in her hand, then touch the handle of the door and immediately after another to reach the handle and to achieve before," said German researcher. Therefore, Streeck considers that there is little chance of transmission through contact with contaminated surfaces so-called.

That infected COVID-19 is a "droplet" that can not be transmitted through the air has been virology Christian Drosten outlined above. He said in an interview that the new coronavirus is highly sensitive to drying, so the only way to contact them is through "inhalation of droplets".

However, there are different theories on how to spread coronavirus. Experts from the US Institute of Health CDC concluded that the virus can survive 24 hours on paper, three hours in air and up to three days on plastics and stainless steel.

Heinsberg center will now be conducting another study on how the virus spread. The study is done on a representative sample of 1,000 people.

"The results of this more detailed study could serve as a basis for recommendations and national strategies out of isolation," said Streeck. "It is important to get this information to ensure that decisions are made based on evidence, not on assumptions," said Hendrik Streeck.
