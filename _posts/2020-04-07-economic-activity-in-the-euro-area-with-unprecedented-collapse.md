It is with the news that economic activity in Europe is making March a faster drop than in the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 that the finance ministers of the euro zone meet on Tuesday by video conference to discuss what response common policy to be taken to mitigate the negative impacts of the new coronavirus in the economy.

The figures released, the first to be known about the period in which economic activity began to be affected, certainly will serve, if still need to reinforce the urgency atmosphere experienced at this point in the Eurogroup.

According to data from IHS Markit, PMI indicator, which measures the level of economic activity in industry and services, registered in the euro area in March, an "unprecedented collapse", changing from 51.6 points in February to 31.4 points. This represents a new record low, surpassing the 36.2 points recorded in February 2009, at the height of the financial crisis.

IHS Markit also revealed that the services sector was "particularly concerned", and the indicator for the sector last 52.6 points to unprecedented 24 points in March.

Against this background, the finance ministers of the eurozone discuss Tuesday what kind of joint measures can be taken. At issue is the possibility for the European Stabilization Mechanism take a role in combating the crisis, notably by opening credit lines to euro area Member States. Nevertheless, there are differences between the capital, with a marked division between the south and north, on what level of risk sharing that should be taken.
