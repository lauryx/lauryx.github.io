Bags fibrillation, expert advice

We are about to close what could be called the "first month pandemic." The first hints of a strong contagion in Europe of Coronavirus date back to February 19th. Since then, the news did not make it worse so that WHO changed the definition of contagion: the one initially hoped was "only" has become an epidemic on balance in a pandemic. And from February 19 onwards investors have drawn the consequences, heavily selling the financial assets considered risky (all actions) and buying hard assets.



THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNT OF A MONTH OF PANDEMIC

The budget of the "first month pandemic" in the financial markets is unprecedented in the history of finance. If the Wall Street crash of 1929, the great financial crash which is still in the collective bubble of the bubbles, the indices took them 42 days before losing 20% ​​compared to historic highs, this time it took them just 16 days . On balance, the S & P 500 - the most important stock index and somewhat less vulnerable to the world - has lost 27% last month, in line with the Japanese Nikkei lost.

The European Bags traveling on even heavier proportions, also because Europe is at this time considered to be the new epicenter of the infection, given that the new Covid-19 targati numbers that arrive from Asia are encouraging and draw a sharp reversal of the curve of infections and deaths. The Ftse Mib was almost halved in the coming months to lose 44% of its value. The Dax 30 in Frankfurt has lost 40%, in line with other continental lists represented by the index Eurostoxx 50 (-40%).



Among the declines also care about high yield bonds, down more than 10 percentage points in both Europe and the US. A decline is also due to the fall in oil (WTI decreased quality of 43% to below $ 30 per barrel). The new price war triggered by Saudi Arabia could have serious repercussions on the American oil shale survival, whose companies make up a substantial part of the index of high-yield bonds in the US. "The recent violent widening of credit spreads feeds fears of corporate failures and a possible, imminent credit crunch," recalls Marco Piersimoni, strategist at Pictet.



These deep fears - that is matched by the index superbalzo of fear, the Vix, which measures the volatility of the markets is that last month went from 14 to 65 points, 350% more - are coming despite the strong measures taken in the meantime by the central banks. Last in order of importance the one announced by the Federal Reserve Sunday, March 15 by cutting the cost of borrowing by 100 basis points to level 0 and allocating 700 billion dollars for the purchase of securities. Year to date the central banks around the world have announced 45 cuts, most of which at least 50 basis points. But for now, these maneuvers have not assuaged the fears of investors, the fact they have fueled considered their exceptional nature that served to emphasize, even if proof were needed, the severity of the situation.
