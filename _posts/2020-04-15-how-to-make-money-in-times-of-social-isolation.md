The world has changed radically since the end of 2019 a contagious virus called coronavirus or COVID-19, fiercely attacked the people of Wuhan, in China.

Few would have imagined how much would happen in the world, when 3 months later all nations have been put on high alert to curb the spread between its citizens, reaching the point where it was mandatory quarantine decree no right to leave homes during 15 days or more.

Many people have been affected because they have been banned completely work out without a clear reason or socialize, which has fostered firms cut staff, consumption is reduced in general and life in cities is limited to only shop at supermarkets or pharmacies (which are the only stores that are allowed to continue their activities).

Some others had no problem because they could agree with their employer to work from home or home office, but they are the minority. The reality is that far too many are searching the internet how to generate income from home today so as not to expose themselves to the danger of being unable to take care of their debts.

There are many ways in which the network can earn an income, it all depends on what you're looking for. Therefore, these are the 4 main ways you can make money online:

1- Work remotely

Also called erroneously as "freelancer" is the main way in which many people earn money through internet. It is an autonomous agency or employment that can be done from anywhere in the world, such as virtual assistant, clerk, customer care, programmer, among others.

The peculiarity of this type of employment is that the person may be comfortable at home, in a mall or on the beach while performing their daily activities. The difference between the Freelance and telecommuter is that the first companies to hire or pay for work done or hourly, while the latter have a fixed salary.

During the global quarantine society is living the XXI century, it has greatly enhanced this type of employment. Especially for businesses that can not stop working in any way, such as customer care or sales online.

Affiliate Marketing 2-

Affiliate marketing is a method used long ago by companies and entrepreneurs that has been gaining strength by the results it has. Basically it is to sell a product or service and get a commission for it.

There are many platforms like Clickbank where you can get all kinds of items to offer. It is a competitive category, but when it manages to position in the market, revenues are obtained quickly.

During 2019 one of the best sellers were the infoproductos, since you can buy in a fully digital and no timeouts.

3- Betting online

Online gambling are not considered a job with which to make money, is only an activity that should be done as a hobby. However, there are a lot of Internet users who earn daily profits in these casinos.

There are different games like poker, blackjack or roulette, each with its own rules and minimum deposit. To get an idea of ​​what the most reliable sites to participate, Jeffrey Hayes of Casinomartini keeps an updated list of the best online casinos, which you can visit for free.

There are also sports betting, where you play for the team, player or preferred outcome. There are many specialties, such as football, basketball, E-sports, baseball, among others.

4- investment platforms

This point is for people who are familiar with the issue of investment and the risk that these entail.

There are platforms that allow profit based on an investment, usually in dollars, for a certain time. For example, if a person invests $ 100 on a platform that gives 1% daily, the end of a month you end up with $ 130, and so on. It is very similar to a fixed term, only that everything done online and most can be removed without delay or capital penalties.

The downside of this is to be studied very well the web portal to be used before depositing, as it may be a malicious site that only seek to raise money and disappear.
